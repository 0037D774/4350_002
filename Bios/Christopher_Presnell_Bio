About Me: I am a Senior and will be graduating this semester in May. I have experience using a mixture of languages for development in a classroom environment mainly using C#
          and Java. I have also completed a year long Internship at Eastman where I got to gain real world development experience in a professional setting and my projects are
          currently being used at Eastman for years to come. I mainly worked as a automation and application programmer that developed solutions to assist with data analytics and
          also projects that were involved with process improvement. I still have a lot to learn and I am always looking for ways to develop my skills.
