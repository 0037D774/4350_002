Hey y'all, I'm Bryson. I'm currently a senior at ETSU, slated to graduate in 2024. I have
most of my experience in coding on backend systems, and server side applications. In SE1 I was a developer, and am well versed in using 
Git/Github. I also have approximately 3 years in a management role at Chick-fil-A.

Some projects:

Server Side Programming Final Project 
  - I created a Blazor server app for users to query and track hiking trails that they want to visit
or have visited. For this project I wrote and stood up my own API using FastAPI on a local server, which the Website interacted with.

1260 Final Project
  - Worked in team of 6 to create a console turn-based game in which had a fully functioning inventory system, map, combat, and level design to
    fight and progress in the game. I worked on the inventory and file I/O (game saving/loading) portions, as well as some level design and 
    feature requirements.
