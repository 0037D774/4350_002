Hello, 

My name is Jasmine, and I am completing an information systems concentration. 

I have worked mainly with C# and SQL in the past, although I have some experience with Python, Java, HTML and CSS. 

Some attributes and skills which would make me a valuable team member include communication, documentation,
& time management skills, dependability, punctuality, professionalism, determination, a desire to learn, and persistence. 

I worked on an individual project due to personal circumstances last semester so working within the group will be a new 
experience for me.
