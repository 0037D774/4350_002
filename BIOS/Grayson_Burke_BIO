Technical Skills:
Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, PL/SQL

I work well in a team setting, communicate well, and take responsibility for my tasks. 
For our project this semester I am more interested in being on the development team, but I am not against picking up the PO or Scrum Master role if needed.
